### Process Name to Network Connections

Sample script for searching an environment for computers that have seen a seen a process based on a file name, collect the SHA256s for the process, and outputing network connections generated by that process.

### Usage
This script reads the API credentials from an api.cfg file, client_id and api_key must be entered there prior to running the script.

To use this script you provide a process name as a command line paramter:
```
python process_name_to_network_connections.py powershell.exe
```

This script has multiple outputs:
* Prints connection information to the console
* Writes a CSV containing connection the IPs, ports, direction, hostname, and GUID
* Writes a log containing basic information about progress

NOTE: This script will process hits from a maximum of 500 endpoints (there is no pagination). If you search for something and it hits on more than 500 endpoints you will not get a complete view of the environment
